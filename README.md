How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Ensuring functionality and security starts with a thorough understanding of the requirements. I prioritize writing clear, modular code and use automated tests to validate functionality. For example, in the Contact service project, I implemented JUnit tests for each critical function to verify the system's behavior under both valid and invalid scenarios. Additionally, I incorporate secure coding practices, such as input validation and exception handling, to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection or buffer overflows. Code reviews and static analysis tools help identify potential security risks before deployment.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Interpreting user needs requires collaboration and clear communication. I break down user requirements into smaller, actionable tasks. For instance, when developing the Contact service, I translated the user’s need for managing contact information into features like adding, deleting, and updating contacts. I ensure that my designs are user-centric by considering edge cases and validating that each feature aligns with the user’s goals. Feedback loops during development further help refine the program to meet user expectations.

How do I approach designing software?

My approach to designing software involves several stages:

Requirements Analysis: Understand the problem and the desired solution.
Planning: Choose appropriate design patterns and tools. For instance, in the task service, I used a modular design to ensure scalability and maintainability.
Implementation: Write clear, reusable, and efficient code with a focus on quality.
Testing and Iteration: Develop comprehensive test cases and iteratively improve the software based on results.
This process ensures that the software is robust, user-friendly, and adaptable to future needs.
